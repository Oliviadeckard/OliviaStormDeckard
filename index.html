<p> I'm an independent artist and graphic designer. I do a wide variety of artwork ranging from pencil and paper to paint brush to a computer screen.
   I love painting more than anything; for sure my hobby or way to cope with all that life has to give. Painting gives me the full range of expression
   I want from everyday life. My paintings are alive with content; there's not one thing the eye can focus on at once the eye is drawn in multiple places at once.
   Iâ€™m currently working on an abstract Rock and Roll series that also incorporates Metal music. I get my inspiration from the album artwork, the fonts the bands
   use, and the marks or symbols and colors that the band uses the most. I take from bands that I normally listen to and sometimes listen to their whole
   discography of work while I paint. The music sounds different after listening to it for so long, it sounds much more intense and passionate.
   I'm a very passionate person myself and try to show that in my work. I will tell you all about how my passion for my own range of artworks
   continues into all of my types of art work no matter what the canvas is. </p>
